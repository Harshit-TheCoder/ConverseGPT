    "what is artificial intelligence": "AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can think and act like humans.",
    "what is machine learning": "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data without explicit programming.",
    "what is deep learning": "Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.",
    "what is supervised learning": "Supervised learning is a type of ML where models are trained on labeled data to make predictions.",
    "what is unsupervised learning": "Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings (e.g., clustering).",
    "what is reinforcement learning": "Reinforcement Learning is an ML technique where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.",
    "what is overfitting": "Overfitting happens when a model learns training data too well, performing poorly on unseen data.",
    "what is underfitting": "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying trend in data.",
    "what is neural network": "A neural network is a system of algorithms inspired by the human brain that recognizes patterns in data.",
    "what is natural language processing": "NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a field of AI that enables machines to understand and process human language.",
    "what is computer vision": "Computer Vision is an AI field that allows computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world.",
    "what is accuracy": "Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.",
    "what is precision": "Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.",
    "what is recall": "Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives in the data.",
    "what is f1 score": "F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics."
